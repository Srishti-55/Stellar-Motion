 You can learn a lot about a star even if it came from a thousand light years away by examining the light that came from it. Using a diffraction gradient you can split the beam of light into  individual wavelengths , just like water droplets splitting sunlight into rainbow

 Measuring the intensity of light at each wavelength gives the star's charactersitic spectrum. Given below is the intensity spectrum of [HD 94028](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=HD+94028), a faint star in the constellation of Leo. Notice the deep spike in the spectrum which indicates that not much light is radiated at this particular wavelength of 650nm .

 This is a common feature of many stars because Hydrogen (a major component of most stars) is absorbs light at precisely 656.3nm. But in this project we will discover that this spike HD 94028's spectrum occurs across a slightly larger wavlength than 656.3nm ,  this is because the star is moving away from Earth.

 Just like how a siren sounds louder as it comes towards you and lower when it goes farther , a star's spectrum is shifted towards lower wavelengths when it comes towards Earth and is shifted towards larger wavelengths when it goes away from Earth. In this project we will use Matlab to find the observed wavelenth of the Hydrogen alpha-line of HD 94028 and compare it to the knnown wavelength of the Hydrogen absorption spectrum to determine how fast the star is moving away from the Earth.

 With precise spectral measurements over time , astronomers use this technique to discover the slight oscillations that demonstrates the presence of planets.
